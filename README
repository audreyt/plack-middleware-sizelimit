NAME
    Plack::Middleware::SizeLimit - Terminate processes if they grow too
    large

SYNOPSIS
        use Plack::Builder;

        builder {
            enable SizeLimit => (
                max_unshared_size_in_kb => '4096', # 4MB
                # min_shared_size_in_kb => '8192', # 8MB
                # max_process_size_in_kb => '16384', # 16MB
                check_every_n_requests => 2,
                log_when_limits_exceeded => 1
            );
            $app;
        };

DESCRIPTION
    This middleware is a port of the excellent Apache::SizeLimit module for
    multi-process Plack servers, such as Starman, Starlet, Gazelle and
    "uWSGI".

    This middleware only works when the environment "psgix.harakiri" is set
    to a true value by the Plack server. If it's set to false, then this
    middleware simply does nothing.

    You must use at least version 0.2006 of Starman (July 2010), and 0.19 of
    Starlet (June 2013). Earlier versions ignore the flag to stop the
    process.

CONFIGURATIONS
    max_unshared_size_in_kb
        The maximum amount of *unshared* memory the process can use; usually
        this option is all one needs.

        Experience on one heavily trafficked mod_perl site showed that
        setting this option and leaving the others unset is the most
        effective policy.

        This is because it only kills off processes that are truly using too
        much physical RAM, allowing most processes to live longer and
        reducing the process churn rate.

    min_shared_size_in_kb
        Sets the minimum amount of shared memory the process must have.

    max_process_size_in_kb
        The maximum size of the process, including both shared and unshared
        memory.

    check_every_n_requests
        Since checking the process size can take a few system calls on some
        platforms (e.g. linux), you may specify this option to check the
        process size every *N* requests. The default value for *N* is 1,
        i.e. to check after the processing of every request.

    log_when_limits_exceeded
        When true, the middleware will log a warning whenever it signals to
        the server that the process is to be terminated. This is false by
        default.

    log_when_limits_exceeded
        When true, a warning will be logged when it kills off a process.
